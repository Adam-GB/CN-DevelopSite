            <h2>
                <br>Blockchain technology can be described as a decentralized, distributed ledger that records the provenance of a digital asset,
                <br> essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.
                <br> Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.
                <br>
                <br>What if, in fact, only a Blockchain can ever own a cryptoasset and a wallet is just a regestered keeper

        <h1>Smart Contracts</h1>
        <P>
            <h2>
                Smart Contracts are programs on the Blockchain that react when certain parameters are met. <br>Imagine a farmer who wants crop insurance, and the contract will react if a parameter is met e.g., <br>if the amount of rainfall in the area
                of the crop is under a certain amount then the smart contract with data recieved from an oracle would react and release the insurance funds agreed within the Smart Contract.

        <h1>dApps</h1>
        <P>
            <h2>
                Decentralized Applications (dApps) are virtual applications or programs that exist on the blockchain, dApps run on a peer-to-peer network.
                <br>Smart Contracts are connected to dApps, some cryptocurrency wallets have dApps integrated within the wallet.
                <br>
                <br>What if, in fact, A Gov issued dApp will become the future N.I number

            <h2>
                Non-Fungible Tokens are digital assets mostly minted as quirky artworks,
                <br>totally unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger that uses blockchain technology to establish proof of ownership.
                <br>They are collectable digital assets that value in cryptocurrency (usually Ethereum)
                <br>Currently the most expensive NFT sold at auction for $69.3 Million US dollars
                <br>
                <br>What if, in fact, NFT's will be used as Metaverse id-citficate's
