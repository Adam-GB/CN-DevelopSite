        <h1>Tulip Mania</h1>
        <h2>

            <p> The tulip breaking virus, this virus made the flowers bloom with colours that appeared flame-like which ultimately made them more desirable.
                <br>Flaming tulip “Samper Augustus”, by 1623 the price for a single Augustus Samper was worth a thousand guilders by the end of 1625 the price had risen to three thousand guilders.
                <br>At the time a skilled carpenter would earn 300 guilders per year. At the hight of tulip mania a single bulb could buy a house a good very bulb could buy a villa this means you could buy an entire street for only a couple of tulip bulbs.
                <br>More and more people joined the tulip trade hoping to buy a couple of bulbs now and sell them for a profit later.
